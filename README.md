# Node.js App Dockerization
The project is designed to showcase the process of containerizing a Node.js application using Docker and the Alpine Linux distribution.

## Project Overview

The Node.js app included in this repository serves as a basic example, and the Dockerfile provided outlines the steps to create a Docker image capable of running the application. By utilizing the lightweight Node.js 19 Alpine image, the resulting Docker container ensures efficiency and a minimal footprint.

## Dockerfile Configuration

The Dockerfile includes instructions for copying application files, setting the working directory, installing dependencies, and starting the Node.js application. It serves as a blueprint for containerizing Node.js projects and can be adapted for real-world applications.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the Dockerfile to build the Docker image and run a container. Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine before proceeding. Feel free to customize the Dockerfile and project structure based on your specific application requirements.
